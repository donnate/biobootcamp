# Importing data

## Working Directory

- The **current working directory** (cmd) is the location
which R is currently pointing to.

- Whenever you try to read or save a file without specifying 
the path explicitly, the cmd will be used by default.

- When are executing code from an R markdown/notebook code chunk, 
the cmd is **the location of the document**.

- To see the current working directory use `getwd()`:
```{r}
getwd()   # with no arguments
```

- To change the working directory use `setwd(path_name)` 
with a specified path as na argument:
```{r eval = FALSE}
setwd("path/to/directory")
```


## Paths and directory names

- R inherits its file and folder **naming conventions from unix**, and 
uses forward slashes for the directories, e.g. `/home/lan/folder/`

- This is, because backslashes serve a different purpose; they are used as 
escape characters to isolate special characters and stop them from being 
immediately interpreted.

- When working with R on **Windows**, you can use either: `C:/Path/To/A/File`
or `C:\\Path\\To\\A\\File`

-  Use a "`Tab`" for autocompletion to find file paths more easily. 

- To avoid problems, directory names should NOT contain spaces and special characters.


## Importing text data

- **Text Files in a table format** can be read and saved 
to a selected variable using a `read.table()` function.
Use `?read.table` to learn more about the function.

- A common text file format is a **comma delimited text file**,
`.csv`. These files use a comma as column separators, e.g:

```{r eval = FALSE}
Year,Student,Major
2009, John Doe,Statistics
2009, Bart Simpson, Mathematics I
```

- To read these files use the following command:

```{r eval=FALSE}
mydata <- read.table("path/to/filename.csv", header=TRUE,  sep = ",")

# read.csv() has covenient argument defaults for '.csv' files
mydata <- read.csv("path/to/filename.csv")
```

- Optionally, use `row.names` or `col.names` arguments
to set the row and column names.



## The `readr` package

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">

Many R packages provide examples of data. 
However, sooner or later you will need to work with your own data.

**`readr` is for reading rectangular text data into R.**
</div>

<img src="./Lecture3-figure/readr.png", height="300"></img> 

<div class="left", style="width: 100%; position: relative; top: -10px">

`readr` supports several file formats with seven `read_<...>` functions:

- `read_csv()`: comma-separated (CSV) files
- `read_tsv()`: tab-separated files
- `read_delim()`: general delimited files
- `read_fwf()`: fixed-width files
- `read_table()`: tabular files where colums are separated by white-space
- `read_log()`: web log files

In many cases it just works: supply path to a file and get a tibble back.

</div>

## Comparison with base R
</br>

Why are we learning the readr package?

- it is up to 10x faster

- it produces tibbles instead of data.frames

- better parsing (e.g. does not convert strings to factors)

- more reproducible on different systems

- progress bar for large files


## Reading comma-separated files

All `read_<...>()` functions have a similar syntax, so we focus on `read_csv()`.

```{r}
# Get path to example dataset
readr_example("mtcars.csv")
```

```{r}
mtcars <- read_csv(readr_example("mtcars.csv"))
```

`mtcars` is a dataset on fuel consumption, and other 10 aspects of design and 
performance (`?mtcars`).


## The `read_csv()` function

Also works with inline csv files (useful for experimenting).

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
read_csv(
  "a,b,c
  1,2,3
  4,5,6"
)
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r}
read_csv(
  "a,b,c
  1,2,3
  4,5,6", 
  col_names=FALSE
)
```
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">
Other useful arguments: skip lines, symbol for missing data.

Now you can read most CSV files, also easily adapt to `read_tsv()`,  
`read_fwf()`. For the others, you need to know how `readr` works inside.

</div>


## How `readr` parses data?

```{r}
parse_logical(c("TRUE","FALSE"))
```

```{r}
parse_integer(c("1","2","3","NA"))
```

Parsing vectors:

- `parse_logical()`, `parse_integer()`
- `parse_double()`, `parse_number()`: for numbers from other countries
- `parse_character()`: for character encodings.
- `parse_datetime()`, `parse_date()`, `parse_time()`
- `parse_factor()`

## Potential difficulties

Parsing data is not always trivial:

- Numbers are written differently in different parts of the world 
(“,” vs “.” for separatimg thousands)

- Numbers are often surrounded by other characters (“$1000”, “10%”)

- Numbers often contain “grouping” characters (“1,000,000”)

- There are many different ways of writing dates and times

- Times can be in different timezones

- Encodings: special characters in other languages

## Locales

A locale specifies common options varying between languages and places

To create a new locale, you use the locale() function:

```{r}
locale(
  date_names = "en", 
  date_format = "%AD", 
  time_format = "%AT",
  decimal_mark = ".", 
  grouping_mark = ",", 
  tz = "UTC",
  encoding = "UTF-8", 
  asciify = FALSE)
```


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# More on locales can be found in a vignette
vignette("locales")
```


## Parsing dates

`parse_date()` expects a four digit year, month, day separated by "-" or "/":

```{r}
parse_date("2010-10-01")
```

Example: French format with full name of month:

```{r}
parse_date("1 janvier 2010")
```


```{r}
parse_date("1 janvier 2010", format="%d %B %Y", locale=locale("fr"))
```


Learn more by typing `?parse_date`


## Parsing times

`parse_time()` expects an "hour : minutes" pair\
(optionally proceeded by ":seconds", and "am/pm" specifier).

```{r}
parse_time("01:10 am")
```

Parsing dates and times:

```{r}
parse_datetime("2001-10-10 20:10", locale = locale(tz = "Europe/Dublin"))
```

For more details, see the book [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html#readr-datetimes)
or use the documentation.

## Parsing numbers

`parse_number()` ignores non-numeric characters before and after.

```{r}
parse_number("20%")
parse_number("$100")
parse_number("cost: $123.45")
```


Parsing numbers with locales

```{r}
# Separation used in Switzerland
parse_number("123'456'789", locale = locale(grouping_mark = "'"))
```

## Parsing real numbers

Real numbers using a different decimal mark

```{r}
parse_double("1,23")
```


```{r}
parse_double("1,23", locale = locale(decimal_mark = ","))
```


## `readr’s` strategy for parsing files

`readr` uses a heuristic to determine column type, using the first 1000 rows.

You can emulate this process with two functions:

- `guess_parser()`: returns readr’s best guess
- `parse_guess()`: uses that guess to parse the column

The heuristic tries a sequence of types, stopping when it finds a match.

If none of these rules apply, then the column will stay as a vector of strings.

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">

```{r}
guess_parser("15:01")
guess_parser("Oct 10, 2010; 15:01")
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r}
parse_guess("12,352,561")
parse_guess(c("TRUE", "FALSE"))
```
</div>



## When the default strategy fails

The default strategy does not always work, e.g. if the first 1000 rows 
might be a special case. Suppose, your dataset with two columns:

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
# Top 1000 lines are (integer, missing)
readLines(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 10)
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r}
# The remaining are (real number, date)
tail(readLines(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 3000), 4)
```
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">
```{r}
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"))
```
</div>



## Examining what went wrong

See problems(...) for more details.

```{r}
problems(challenge)
```


## Fixing the column specifications


```{r}
# Automatic colomn specifications are:
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(x = col_integer(), y = col_character()) )
```

```{r}
# It seems that first column should be a real number:
( challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
    col_types = cols(x = col_double(), y = col_character()) ) )
```



## Fixing the column specifications 

Are we done? Check the “y” column

```{r}
tail(challenge)
```

Not yet: dates are stored as strings. To fix this, we use:

```{r}
challenge <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(x = col_double(), y = col_date() ) )
```


Every `parse_<...>()` function has a corresponding `col_<...>()` function.
 `col_<...>()` tells readr how to load the data.


## Diagnosing problems

Maybe easier to diagnose problems if all columns are read as characters:

```{r}
challenge2 <- read_csv(readr_example("challenge.csv"), 
  col_types = cols(.default = col_character()) )
head(challenge2, 3)
```

and then use `type_convert()` to apply parsing heuristics to character columns.

```{r}
head(type_convert(challenge2), 3)
```


## Importing other types of data

We will not go into the details in this course.
We only list a few other useful packages for importing data.

Rectangular data:

- Package `haven` reads SPSS, Stata, and SAS files.
- Package `readxl` reads excel files (both .xls and .xlsx).
- Package `DBI`, along with a database specific backend (e.g. RMySQL, 
RSQLite, RPostgreSQL etc) allows you to run SQL queries against a database 
and return a data frame.

Hierarchical data:

- `jsonlite` for json (common for browser-server communications)
- `xml2` for XML (common for textual data in web services)

And many more are available.

# Tidying data 


## What is tidy data?
 
There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

- Each variable must have its own column.

- Each observation must have its own row.

- Each value must have its own cell.

![](./Lecture3-figure/tidy_table.png)
Source: http://r4ds.had.co.nz


## Datasets in different forms

Each dataset shows the same values of four variables **country, year, 
population, and number of TB cases**, but each dataset organises the values in a 
different way.


<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
table1
```

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
table2
```
</div>

##

In this example, only `table1` is tidy. It’s the only representation where 
each column is a variable.


<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
table3
```

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
table4a
```

```{r}
table4b
```

</div>



## Why tidy data?
 
- If you pick one consistent way of storing data, then you can reuse the same tools.

- R is naturally vectorized. Most built-in R functions work with vectors of values.

- `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and other packages in the `tidyverse` are designed to work
with tidy data.


## Why you need to know how to tidy data?
 

- You cannot assume data will come in as tidy. In fact, most data is not.

- Many people aren’t familiar with the principles of tidy data.

- Data is often organised to facilitate some use other than analysis,
e.g. storage efficiency, compactness or ease of data entry.


This means for most real analyses, you’ll need to do some tidying.

## The `tidyr` package

<div class="left", style="width: 70%">
> Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way. \
–– Hadley Wickham

In the tidyverse, tidying data is done with `tidyr` package.

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 30%">
![](./Lecture3-figure/tidyr.png)
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">

The same data can be represented in many different ways. Some are 
more practical than others.

</div>


## Spreading, gathering, separating and uniting columns

**First step.** Determine what are the variables and what are the observations.

**Second step.** Often, you need to deal with some of the following issues:

- One variable is spread across multiple columns $\implies$ need to `gather()`.

- One observation might be scattered across multiple rows $\implies$ need to `spread()`.

- One column contains values fore multiple variables $\implies$ need to `separate()`.

- Multiple columns store information on a single variable $\implies$ need to `unite()`.

`tidyr` can help you solve these problems.


## Gathering
 
**Common problem:** some column names are not the names, 
but the values of a variable.

```{r}
table4a
```

`gather()` makes **wide tables narrower and longer**:

![](./Lecture3-figure/gathering.png)


## Gathering

To tidy up `table4a`, we need to `gather()` those columns into a new pair
of variables. We need three pieces of information to do this:

- The set of columns that represent values, not variables.

- The name for the variable whose values are given in **these columns' names**
(the `key`).

- The name for the variable whose values are spread over **these columns' cells** 
(the `value`).

<div class="left", style="width: 35%">
```{r}
table4a
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 65%">
```{r}
gather(table4a, `1999`:`2000`, key = year, value = cases)
```
</div>



## Spreading

Spreading is the opposite of gathering, and you use it when **an observation 
is scattered across multiple rows**.

`spread()` makes **long tables shorter and wider**:

![](./Lecture3-figure/spreading.png)



## Spreading 

To spread up `table2`, we only need two parameters:

- The column that contains variable names (the `key`).

- The column that contains values from multiple variables (the `value`).

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
table2
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
spread(table2, key = type, value = count)
```
</div>


## Separate

Sometimes, a dataset has a column with values corresponding to multiple
variables. 

We might want to split such a column into multiple new ones.

`separate()` **makes narrow tables wider.**


![](./Lecture3-figure/separate.png)


## Separate

`separate()` splits one column into multiple columns wherever a separator 
appears.

<div class="left", style="width: 45%">
```{r}
table3
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 55%">
```{r}
separate(table3, col = rate, 
         into = c("cases", "population"))
```
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">

Some important features of `separate()`

- by default, it splits values wherever it sees a non-alphanumeric character. 
You can specify the separator.
```{r, eval = FALSE}
separate(table3, rate, into = c("cases", "population"), sep = "/")
```
 
- by default, it leaves the type of the column as is. 
You can ask it to convert to better types. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
separate(table3, col = rate, into = c("cases", "population"), convert = T)
```

</div>


## Unite

`unite()` is the opposite of `separate()`:\
it combines multiple columns into a single column.

`unite()` **makes wider tables narrower.**

![](./Lecture3-figure/unite.png)

## Unite

`unite()` takes arguments:

1. a `tibble` (or `data.frame`)
1. the name of the new column
1. names of columns to be combined
1. a separator used when uniting the columns

</br>

<div class="left", style="width: 50.5%">
```{r}
table5
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 49.5%">
```{r}
unite(table5, col = full_year, century, year, 
      sep = "")
```
</div>



# Transforming data

## The `dplyr` package

</br>

The `dplyr` package is also a part of the core `tidyverse`, which:

<div class="left", style="width: 70%">
- Introduces **a grammar of data manipulation**.

- Gives a **code-efficient** for way for data exploration and transformation.

- Is **fast on data frames** (written in C++): has speed of C and ease of R.

- **Intuitive to write and easy to read**, esp. when using the *chaining* syntax.
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 30%">
![](./Lecture3-figure/dplyr.png)
</div>

<div class="left", style="width: 100%">
</br>

You should use `dplyr` even as a beginner R user, and [here is why](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/).


## `dplyr` verbs (functions)

</br>

`dplyr` utilities handle the vast majority of your data manipulation needs:

- `filter()` - for picking observations by their values,

- `select()` - for picking variables by their names,

- `arrange()` - for reorder the rows,

- `mutate()` - for creating new variables with functions on existing variables, 

- `summarise()` - for collapse many values down to a single summary. 

</br>
All of the above can be done using **base R functions, but they would be less 
computationally efficient, and require writing more lines of (ugly) code.** 


## The structure of `dplyr` functions

</br>

All verbs work similarly:

- The first argument is a tibble (or data frame)

- The subsequent ones describe what to do, using the variable names

- The result is a new tibble

</br>

Learn more about `dplyr` from a 
[turtorial](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i8qnluwmuieicxc/AAAgt9tIKoIm7WZKIyK25lh6a?preview=dplyr-tutorial.pdf) written by its creator, Hadley Wickham.


## The movie industry dataset

`movies.csv` contains information on last three decades of movies. 


The data has been scraped from the IMDb website and can be accessed from a [github repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Juanets/movie-stats/master/movies.csv).


```{r, width = 100, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Juanets/movie-stats/master/movies.csv"
movies <- read_csv(url)
movies
```


## `filter()`: retain rows matching a criteria

`filter()` allows you to subset observations based on their values.

```{r}
# note: both comma and "&" represent AND condition
filter(movies, genre == "Comedy", director == "Woody Allen")
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# base R approach would be more wordy:
movies[movies$genre == "Comedy" & movies$director == "Woody Allen", ]
```

Package `dplyr` executes the filtering and returns a new data frame.
**It never modifies the original one.**

## Logical operators

Multiple arguments to `filter()` are combined with “and”: all expressions must 
be true, for a row to be included in the output. For other types of combinations,
you’ll need to use Boolean operators yourself: & is “and”, | is “or”, and ! is “not”:

![](./Lecture3-figure/transform-logical.png)

<smal> Source: [R for data science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)</small>

## 


```{r, eval  = FALSE}
# Using AND operator
filter(movies, country == "USA", budget > 2.5e8) 
# same as filter(movies, country == "USA" & budget > 2.5e8)

# Using OR operator
filter(movies, country == "USA" | budget > 2.5e8)

# Using xor()
filter(movies, xor(score > 9, budget > 2.5e8))
```

```{r}
# you can also use %in% operator
filter(movies, country %in% c("Peru", "Colombia", "Chile"))
```



## `select()`: pick columns by name

`select()` let's you choose a subset variables, specified by name.

Note, there is no need for quotation marks in `dplyr`:
```{r}
# dplyr approach
select(movies, name, country, year, genre)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# base R approach would be:
movies[, c("name", "year", "genre")]
```


##

```{r}
select(movies, name, genre:score) # use colon to select contiguous columns, 
```

```{r}
select(movies, -(star:writer))    # To drop columns use a minus, "-" 
```



## `select()` helpers

You can use the following functions to help select the columns:

- `starts_with()`
- `ends_with()`
- `contains()`
- `matches()` (matches a regular expression)
- `num_range("x", 1:4)`: pickes variables x1, x2, x3, x4

Examples:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
select(movies, starts_with("r"))
select(movies, ends_with("e"))
select(movies, contains("re"))
```


## `arrange()`: reorder rows

`arrange()` takes a data frame and a set of column names to order by. \
For descending order, use the function `desc()` around the column name.

```{r}
print(arrange(movies, runtime), n = 4)

# use `desc` for descending
print(arrange(movies, desc(budget)), n = 4)
```

## `mutate()`: add new variables

`mutate()` adds new columns that are a function of the existing ones

```{r}
movies <- mutate(movies, profit = gross - budget)
select(movies, name, gross, budget, profit)
```

To discard old variables, use `transmute()` instead of `mutate()`.


```{r eval = FALSE}
# base R approach to create a new variable 'profit'
movies$profit <- movies$gross - movies$budget
```

##

```{r}
# Generating multiple new variables
movies <- mutate(
  movies, 
  profit = gross - budget, 
  gross_in_mil = gross/10^6,
  budget_in_mil = budget/10^6,
  profit_in_mil = profit/10^6
)
select(movies, name, year, country, contains("_in_mil"), profit)
```


<div class="left", style="width: 100%; font-size: 0.7em;">
**Any vectorized function can be used with `mutate()`**, including:

- arithmetic operators  (+,-,*,/, %, %%), 
- logical operators (<,<=,>,>=,==,!=),
- logarithmic and exponential transfomations (`log, log10, exp`), 
- offsets (`lead, lag`), 
- cummulative rolling aggregates (`cumsum`, `cumprod`, `cummin`, `cummax`),
- ranking (`min_rank`, `percent_rank`).
</div>


## `summarise()`: reduce variables to values

</br>

`summarize()` can be used to aggregate data or to compute a summarizing value 
of interest.

```{r}
summarise(movies, 
  tot_gross_in_bil = sum(gross)/1e9, 
  mean_gross_in_mil = mean(gross)/1e6, 
  mean_profit_in_mil = mean(profit)/1e6
)
```

`summarize()` is **more useful on data previously grouped by 
one or more variables** using `group_by()`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
by_genre <- group_by(movies, genre)
summarize(by_genre, tot_gross_in_bil = sum(gross)/1e9, 
          mean_gross_in_mil = mean(gross)/1e6, 
          mean_profit_in_mil = mean(profit)/1e6)
```

## Grouping and summarizing

Grouing allows you to compute summaries for each categories separately:

```{r}
by_genre <- group_by(movies, genre)
summarize(
  by_genre, 
  tot_gross_in_bil = sum(gross)/1e9, 
  mean_gross_in_mil = mean(gross)/1e6, 
  mean_profit_in_mil = mean(profit)/1e6
)
```

## Elementary but useful summary functions

- `min(x)`, `median(x)`, `max(x)`, `quantile(x, p)`
- `n()`, `n_distinct()`, `sum(x)`, `mean(x)`
- `sum(x > 10)`, `mean(x > 0)`
- `sd(x)`, `var(x)`


## Counting observations

`tally()` function can be used to generate a group frequency table,
(number of observations in each category)

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
tally(group_by(movies, genre))
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
tally(group_by(movies, genre, country))
```
</div>



## Window Functions

- Aggregation functions such as `mean()`, `n()` return 1 value per group.

- **Window functions return multiple values per group**, e.g.
`top_n()`, `lead` and `lag` or `cummean`:

```{r}
# rewrite more simply with the `top_n` function
movies2 <- select(movies, name, genre, country, year, budget, gross, profit, rating, score)
top2 <- top_n(group_by(movies2, genre), n = 2, wt = score)
arrange(top2, genre, year, score)  
```  



## Other useful functions in `dplyr` 

```{r}
# Renaming variables
print(rename(movies2, gross_revenue = gross), n = 5)
```

<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
# Unique values
distinct(movies2, rating)
```
</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
# Using multiple variables, returns distinct variable combinations.
distinct(movies2, rating, genre)
```
</div>



## Sampling observations

```{r}
sample_n(movies, 5)                    # fixed number of rows, without replacement
sample_frac(movies, 0.005, replace=TRUE) # fraction of rows, with replacement
```



# Chaining operations

## The `magrittr` package

<div class="left", style="width: 65%">

> The magrittr (to be pronounced with a sophisticated french accent) package 
has two aims: decrease development time and improve readability and 
maintainability of code

`magrittr` provides a "pipe"-like operator, `%>%`:

- The `%>%` is used **pipe values forward into an expression or function call**.
- In the pipe notation, you use `x %>% f(y)`, rather than `f(x, y)`.
- This is similar to the [Unix pipes](http://www.linfo.org/pipe.html),
`|`, used to send the output of one program to another program for 
further processing.

</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 35%">

![](./Lecture3-figure/magrittr.png)

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
columns <- 1:50
rnorm(500) %>%
  matrix(ncol = 50) %>%
  colSums() %>%
  plot(x = columns)
```

</div>



## Chaining operations

</br>

- Pipe operators used together with `dplyr` functions make a large
difference as they semantically change your code in a way that 
**makes it more intuitive to both read and write**. 

- The pipes allow users to chain operators which reflects the 
**sequential nature of data-processing tasks**.

- **Chaining increases readability** significantly when there are 
many commands 

- `%>%` operator is automatically imported into `dplyr`

##

(1) Find movies from USA produced after 2010. (2) Group by genre and
(3) compute the group mean gross revenue in million dollars. Then print the genre
mean 'gross' revenue (4) arranged in a descending order: 


<div class="left", style="width: 50%">
```{r}
# nesting 
arrange(
  summarise(
    group_by(
      filter(movies, 
             year > 2010, country == "USA"
      ),
      genre
    ),
    mean_gross = mean(gross)/10^6
  ),
  mean_gross
)
```


</div>

<div class="right", style="width: 50%">

```{r}
# chaining 
movies %>%
  filter(year > 2010, country == "USA") %>%
  group_by(genre) %>%
  summarise(mean_gross = mean(gross)/10^6) %>%
  arrange(mean_gross)
```

</div>
